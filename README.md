# kanboro

### Features

### Developer Guide
A single-page, full stack, web application with user authentication. Users are able to edit their own kanban board with CRUD capabilities on tasks. Users can set number of intervals of time on each task and run a timer to complete a single interval. This timer is inspired by the Pomodoro method and defaults to 25 minutes, however users can edit this time in their settings.
