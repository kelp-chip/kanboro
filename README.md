# kanboro

A single-page web application that lets you log in and create your own kanban board. Tasks can be given a number of intervals you think it will take to complete them. You can set the length of your intervals in user settings. Once you click start on a task, the task will automatically be pushed to the top of the in progress list and a timer will begin. At the end of the timer, the number of intervals on the task will increment. Once all intervals for the task has been reached it will automatically be pushed to your completed list.
